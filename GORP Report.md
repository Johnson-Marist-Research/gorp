# GORP Summer Research Project
### Presented by Cayleigh Goberman, Melissa Chodziutko, and Matthew Johnson

## Introduction
- What GORP is
- Why each person was recruited for the project

## Background
- Original idea of crossing GOAP and cybersecurity (refer to proposal)

## Problem that Research Addresses
- Ability for GORP to switch between tasks on the fly and make dynamic decisions

## Objectives
- Protect the device from malicious activity
- Make it easier for users to implement cybersecurity actions
- Allow the program to adapt dynamically to a variety of situations

## Process
- Timeline of the project

## Further Considerations
GORP regrettably suffered from a series of bugs and logical errors that burned precious time while we searched for an effective solution. Since GORP's algorithm involves a series of careful calculations and pathfinding actions, a single error in one section of the code can have catastrophic effects further down the planning process. Not only did we have to solve these problems, but we also had to locate them in the first place, which could be slightly difficult given how many processes cascaded down into each other. As such, debugging soon became a time-consuming process. In the future, it might be wise to create built-in checks at the beginning of each step; therefore, if the program is crashing or getting lost at a specific point, we can immediately refer to the checks in order to hopefully narrow down its location in less time. We ultimately implemented checks that funciton similarly to this idea, but they are a bit disjointed since they were added at various points in development and without an overarching structure.
Unfortunately, this project was limited by a few different factors that most likely negatively affected the final product. We were alotted 300 hours to develop GORP over the summer; while this proved to be ample time to cement the basic components, we were unfortunately forced to drop some of our more ambitious goals, such as adding more cybersecurity features. Additionally, the one constant programmer that was present for this project had experience in game programming, but not much in cybersecurity. This slowed down the process slightly as they had to check their work whenever they delved into more complex cybersecurity and internetworking tasks.
